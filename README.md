🌱 Crop Disease Prediction System

A machine learning–powered system that predicts plant leaf diseases from images with high accuracy.
The system processes an uploaded leaf image, classifies the disease using a trained CNN model, and provides confidence scores along with suggested remedies.
It is designed to assist farmers, agriculture researchers, and precision-farming applications.
